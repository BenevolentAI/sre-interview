# Docker: Technical Scenario

To help us best understand where you're at as an engineer, we've created this example scenario of the kind of work that is common for an SRE at Benevolent.

Inside this directory is an extremely trivial Python application using Flask. Your task will vary depending on your level of existing Docker expertise.

Whichever approach you take, we expect you'll spend about an hour on this.

## I haven't used Docker much

If you've never created a Docker container before, this exercise is meant to evaluate your ability to research a new technology. At the end of all this, you may not have a functioning Docker container, but you should be able to describe the steps you took.

A good place to start is probably a Google search for "how to create a Docker container", but after a little preliminary research, you may want to try https://docker-curriculum.com which covers all the basics of Docker usage.

Another thing that you may want to brush up on is how you run a Flask app. Although `python server.py` is the gist of it, you may also want to try a search for "Dockerize your Flask App".

## I have some Docker experience

For those who have some exposure to Docker, the task isn't much different, only this time your goal is specifically to end up with a running Docker container. If you run into issues that you can't resolve in the hour or so you have allocated, make sure to write them down so we can try to work through them during your interview.
